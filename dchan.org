* dchan

  Dchan is a server that exposes channels for inter-process
  communications (IPC) over a file tree interface.  These channels are
  much like Go channels and can be used in the same way but between
  processes.  Instead of implementing a new protocol for data exchange
  like AMQP, Dchan uses a simple file interface.  There's no need of
  client libraries for each language (every language knows how to read
  and write from files).

  Dchan is able to share those files in the network with the help of
  the 9P protocol.

  This project uses the concept of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][Literate Programming]] of Donald
  Knuth.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of
programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a
computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human
beings what we want a computer to do. \cite{Knuth:1984:LiterateProgramming}
#+END_QUOTE

  This book is the only source for design ideas, code, documentation and
  tests. From here, we build everything.

** Why dchan?

   Dchan was created as an alternative technology for data processing
   pipelines. The classic approach to data processing is to write a
   program that reads in data, transforms it in some desired way, and
   outputs new data. Such programs, when chained, forms an
   architecture called "data pipeline". An obvious example is UNIX
   pipes, that works very well when all programs share the same
   address space. For distributed architectures, a more elaborate
   solution must be used to perform message passing between different
   machines. Below are some common used technologies:

   - Broker (message oriented middlewares)
     - AMQP
       - RabbitMQ
       - Qpid
       - ActiveMQ
     - NATS
     - NSQ
     - Kafka
     - Redis
   - Brokerless (message passing libraries)
     - ZeroMQ
     - Nanomsg
     - Akka (actor concurrency model)
     - Erlang OTP

   The brokered solution could be splited into two classes:

   - With database capabilities (persistence, guarantees)
     - RabbitMQ
     - QPid
     - ActiveMQ
     - NSQ
     - Kafka
     - Redis
   - In-memory queues
     - NATS

   Using the brokered solutions listed above means that will exists a
   message queue between every program that consumes data. This queue
   is called /worker queue/ and can be in-memory or persistent
   depending on the solution.

   Some brokers with built-in database can be configured to work as
   in-memory queues too (RabbitMQ, Qpid, NSQ, Redis), but in this
   case, to avoid memory starvation, it should use some kind of
   watermark configuration, to activate persistence, or drop new
   messages, when the memory is over the threshold (See [[https://www.rabbitmq.com/memory.html][here]], [[http://nsq.io/deployment/production.html][here]],
   [[http://redis.io/topics/memory-optimization][here]] and [[https://qpid.apache.org/releases/qpid-0.32/cpp-broker/book/chapter-Managing-CPP-Broker.html][here]]).

   After some time using RabbitMQ, and then studying other solutions,
   we discovered that majority of current technologies aren't good
   enought to solve our specific use cases.

   The problem is that, when the worker queue grow indefinitely,
   because of slow consumers throughput compared to publishers or
   because some consumers crashed, two things can happen:

   - Memory starvation (in case of no persistence)
   - Abruptly performance degradation

   In a high volume data processing, the difference of throughput
   between publishers and consumers can lead to lots of terabytes
   waiting to be processed if not properly handled.

   The entire application being down because of OOM in the broker
   isn't a good option for data processing, then NATS doesn't
   satisfies the basic requirement. NATS has a simple and good
   architecture but unusable for data processing because it turns the
   problem even worst, by automatically disconnecting slow consumers
   freeing their queues.

   The persistence option saves the broker of OOM, but the performance
   degradation turns the problem even worst for consumers, because now
   every delivery will hit the disk. For continuous data processing,
   this means that when the broker hit the watermark, it will never
   restore the performance of in-memory queues again and database will
   grow infinitely. In this case, a proper database is desirable
   instead of a message queue.

   Kafka is a distributed commit log service with strong guarantees
   that can be used as message broker. To avoid memory starvation
   kafka could be configured to flush data to disk at some time
   interval (log.flush.interval.ms) or flush when a specific amount of
   messages exists in memory (log.flush.interval.messages). The last
   config is much like watermark's configurations, but the
   difference is that it represents the amount of messages, not a size
   in memory. Kafka uses the configuration log.retention.hours to
   determine the amount of time to retain data on disk. The problem of
   slow consumers could be solved slowing down the producers with
   quota's settings (quota.publisher.default) being configured by some
   worker manager.

   Kafka apparently is the broker most prepared for high volume
   continuous data processing pipeline, but this have the cost of
   configurability and tuning.

   The feature that is lacking in all brokers is fixed-size queues
   with synchronization between publishers and consumers.

   Fixed size queues will avoid memory starvation and with synchronism
   the publishers will wait until the consumers are ready to get
   data. The performance of a data pipeline is best measured by the
   performance of the last services of the chaining, because they're
   generating the useful, ready-to-be-used, enriched data. If no
   bottleneck exists in the architecture, with synchronized services
   what we'll achieve is the same performance throughput across the
   entire pipeline (the performance of the slowest service).

   Using the brokerless alternatives cited before we can implement the
   required synchronism and avoid infinite queues, but this requires
   additional [[http://hintjens.com/blog:32][service discovery capabilities to every micro-service of the
   architecture]].

   Dchan is an alternative to the brokered solutions but providing
   ad-hoc synchronization. Dchan helps micro-services to communicate
   transparently. It's much like a rendezvous point in your network,
   where different services met in order to exchange data
   directly. Dchan uses the CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes)
   style of concurrency to create channels of data, enabling direct
   inter-process communication without requiring service discovery.

** Current situation

   Today we use RabbitMQ service for message passing inter-teams and
   at several places of architecture and apart from the broker
   problems explained in the last chapter, it proved to be hard
   to achieve high quality code.

   AMQP (Advanced Message Queue Protocol) is a complex bad designed
   specification protocol and because of that, client libraries are
   huge and sometimes buggy. On top of a huge library, the
   specification still imposes a lot of client code to achieve
   durability and reliability. That big amount of code (and tests)
   needs to be written in the correct manner and must be correctly
   tested. Testing is hard because the need for a central complete
   broker (not easy to mock with libraries) and some way to start/stop
   the broker for test re-connection and guarantees (durability). In
   simple words: hard to achieve good quality code.

   For more information about this kind of problems, read the article
   below from one of the AMQP creators:

   http://www.imatix.com/articles:whats-wrong-with-amqp/

   Other problem is that AMQP specification does not say any words
   about synchronism between publishers and consumers of queues, and
   the broker is designed to be a complete database to store the
   difference between throughput of clients. Sometimes this is a
   desired behavior, but sometimes it is not. If you have a low
   traffic messaging, it works, but using the message broker as a
   database for a large dataset processing requires more database
   capabilities in the broker than messaging (and AMQP is a messaging
   protocol).

** Desired goals

Dchan have the goals below:

- It must have a simple API;
- It must support text messages over the wire;
- It must support composability or inter-dchan communications;
- It must support unicast and multicast;
- It must be easy for testing;
- It must scale;

* API

To achieve the first goal dchan uses a file tree interface over
network. Simple files (real disk files) aren't suitable for IPC
because of the global nature of the disk incurring races in concurrent
access between processes. But UNIX operating systems supports the idea
of virtual file systems (VFS), an abstraction layer on top of a more
concrete file system, to make possible client application's
interact with different kind of concrete file systems in a uniform
way. In practical, VFS is a kernel interface (or contract) to file
system drivers.

On linux, every file system driver implements the VFS contract, and
then it's possible to every program that read and write on files to
use any file system without code changes. It's good because old tools
like cat, sed, tail, and so on, can be used for network file systems
without changes. The VFS is useful to build stackable (or union fs
mounts) file systems and this will be explained in the [[Composability][Composability]]
section.

Network file systems are a class of file systems that (commonly) map
userspace IO operations into remote procedure calls, turning possible
interact with remote resources as if it were local. NFS (Network File
System) and 9P works this way, the former being a very complex
protocol commonly used with kernel drivers on client and server side,
but the latter being very simple, allowing userspace file servers. For
9P exists tons of libraries for various programming languages to
develop clients and servers. For NFS exists only one server side
implementation in userspace and no library for creating new file
servers.

Dchan uses the 9P as network file system protocol behind the
scenes. This mean that you can mount the dchan file-tree
locally and interact with channels as if it were simple files in the
mounted directory.

Linux kernel have native support in the kernel to create 9P clients
(not servers), making easy to mount dchan file trees in each linux box.

For more information on 9P implementation see the link below:

http://9p.cat-v.org/implementations

* CSP Communication Semantics

Dchan uses the Communicating Sequential Processing semantics on top of
the virtual file interface. At core of the CSP semantics are two
fundamental ideas:

- Atomic communication
- Non-deterministic choice.

It's the same concepts as independently defined by Robin Milner in the
Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS)[fn:1].

** Atomic communication

Atomic communication is obtained by rendezvous points. Rendezvous
points are places in time and space, where processes who are trying to
communicate, meet each other in order to occur the communication. During
rendezvous both the sender and receiver processes block until the
other side is ready to communicate and implies that the sending and
receiving of a message occurs simultaneously.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A real world analogy to rendezvous can be found in telephone
communications (without answering machines). Both the caller and
callee must be simultaneously present for a phone conversation to
occur.
Neil Smith at [[http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/papers/99/HMAD/html/csp.html][CSP Domain]]
#+END_QUOTE

The image below shows the communication between Process A and B. At
some moment in time Process A blocks in the Send call because of
Process B isn't ready to communicate. When Process B calls Recv, the
communication happens, data is transferred from Process A to B and
Process A finally unblock and continue execution.

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:images/rendezvous.png]]

Depending on the CSP implementation, channels can be buffered, in
other words, in this way it's a queue with limited size. But
independently of channel type, the following is true:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Senders will block when channel is full and receivers will block when
channel is empty.  The communication is atomic only when the channel
is unbuffered.
#+END_QUOTE

Then, when the channel is unbuffered, senders will always block
waiting for a receivers and receivers will always block waiting for a
sender.

** Non-deterministic choice

Non-deterministic choice provides processes with the ability to
randomly select between a set of possible atomic communications. In
the Go programming language the construct for this is called
"select"[fn:3], other languages call it "alt". Select statements
choose which of a set of possible send or receive operations will
proceed and is very useful when dealing with more than 1 channel per
process.

** Dchan CSP semantics

Dchan supports atomic communications and it is guaranteed to be atomic
across the network with the help of the 9P file abstraction.

Non-deterministic choice, in the other hand, is a much more complex
task to implement in distributed way and escapes from the file
semantics. The problem arises from the fact that it requires a special
API to "mark" a set of channels to participate in the "select", but
the most closest file's syscall to achieve this transparently are
select/poll/epoll, but they doesn't map to any 9P message in the
protocol. Dchan doesn't support "select", but apart from being complex
to implement and requiring an API, it could be implemented in the
future.

* Client interface

To mount a new dchan file server is required only few commands.
On a stock linux kernel, what you need to type is:

#+begin_src bash
mkdir -p /n/dchan
mount -t 9p -o port=6666,dfltuid=`id -u`,dfltgid=`id -g` \
    192.168.10.56 /n/dchan <ip-of-dchan-server> /n/dchan
#+end_src

The mount command above will use the linux kernel to establish a new
client connection to the file server. Once established, the kernel
will present the remote file system in the /n/dchan directory. After
that you can use traditional unix tools (file, cat, sed, etc) to
interact with the files on it.

* Trade-offs

Using a file interface have several benefits, but some problems
too.

- Error handling: The network is a lot more unreliable than local disk
  and this can be a source of problems if programmers do not
  understand this correctly. The majority of software does not handle
  disk failures and does not try to remount the file system if the
  hardware enter in a failure state, but when using network, failures
  happens all the time and programs needs to be aware of that.

- Framing: Each software in the conversation needs to agree in what is
  their understanding of a message. If no convention is used between
  all of the softwares, then some kind of framing protocol must be
  used to ensure only complete messages are interpreted. The problem
  arises from two facts: First, each software can use whatever value
  it want in the amount of bytes of the read and write syscalls,
  leading to some programs processing incomplete messages if the
  amount of bytes disagree. Second, sending bytes over the network
  link isn't an atomic operation, and for that reason, send/write
  syscalls for socket commonly returns the amount of bytes completely
  sent. If the other end cannot identify that the packets received
  aren't a complete message then it can process corrupt or incomplete
  data.


Solutions to the problems above are proposed in the section
[[Implementation][Implementation]].

* Messaging

Using a file interface messaging is simpler:

| syscall      | dchan semantics / effect     |
|--------------+------------------------------|
| open         | Open an existing channel     |
| open(OCREAT) | Create a new channel         |
| read         | Read messages from channel   |
| write        | Write a message into channel |
| stat         | Get info of channel          |
| close        | Close the channel            |
| unlink       | Remove an existing channel   |

** Text messages

Dchan has the principle of being simple and easy to debug. To the
latter be possible, is strongly encouraged the use of text-based
messages instead of binary or compacted text. We'll not optimize it
for performance until we really reach that point.

Using a text message format we can simplify both the clients and
server.

- No need for libraries to encode/decode messages;
- Easy to debug in the network;
- Easy to testing;

* Composability

It's possible to create a virtual file system representation of
multiple dchan file servers. It's useful for inter-teams
communications without the need of using a central dchan server.
This feature is given by union file system capabilities of the
Operating System.

The Linux and BSD kernels supports various flavours of union file
system drivers, but this section will demonstrate the use of the most
recent union file system of the Linux Kernel called `overlayfs`.

From Linux documentation:

#+begin_quote
An overlay filesystem combines two filesystems - an 'upper' filesystem
and a 'lower' filesystem.  When a name exists in both filesystems, the
object in the 'upper' filesystem is visible while the object in the
'lower' filesystem is either hidden or, in the case of directories,
merged with the 'upper' object. @@html:<div
align="right"><i>@@Neil Brown in [[https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/overlayfs.txt][OverlayFS Documentation]].@@html:</i></div>@@
#+end_quote

Using this concept is possible to create file trees composed of
multiple dchan servers without the needs of implementing anything on
it.


* Testing

Developing a distributed software involves lots of testing because
failures occurs very frequently. When you build a local software, with
the entire business logic running at one local memory address space,
we can ignore the majority of operating system and hardware faults and
focus only in testing the logic inside the program's source code. But
when software's logic is spread in the network, several classes of
bugs can arises because pieces of the logic are on a remote machine.

On linux, any file system syscall executed on a disconnected mounted
9P file system will result in a -EIO error (Input/Output
error). Applications using dchan should verify the return value of
read/write functions and, if the value returned is -EIO, then it
should re-open the file when a re-connection with the file server is
finished. To re-connect, a new mount syscall establishing a new client
connection with the file server is required. Linux mount supports the
remount option, enabling then to reuse the mount point already used by
applications (no need to cwd again to directory). The remount can be
done explicitly by the application using dchan or by an external
software. This topic will be more detailed in the section [[dchan-proxy][dchan-proxy]].

* Terminology

This document uses a number of terms to refer to the roles played by
participants in, and objects of, the Dchan communication.

- goroutine: Go lightweight threads that represent anonymous processes
  in the CSP terminology.
- channel: Entity shared between processes whose purpose is to provide
  means of communication.
- Rprocess: Reader goroutine of a read 9P request.
- Wprocess: Writer goroutine of a write 9P request.

* Architecture

Dchan is a file server that exposes the Go channels with a file tree
interface. Every new 9P connection established will create a new
goroutine for handle the subsequent requests and every created file in
the tree will spawn 2 other goroutines (one for read and one for write
requests) and create a channel shared between this two goroutines.

The size of channels is 0 (unbuffered) by default and it can be
changed using the ctl file.

Every read request will block Rprocess when the channel is empty. And
every write request will block the Wprocess when the channel is
full. When the channel is unbuffered, the communication is atomic
inside Dchan, as stated by CSP concepts explained in the chapter [[CSP Communication Semantics][CSP
Communication Semantics]].

To guarantee the atomicity of the messaging across Dchan clients the
messaging algorithm need to be designed in some way that Wprocess only
returns to the caller when Rprocess successfully delivered the message
to the client consumer.

When channel is unbuffered (with size equals 0), the file server
*do not* store the messages in any way, it only transfer the written data
from the Wprocess to Rprocess, that will then deliver the data
to the consumer. Dchan is only able to guarantee that data was
delivered to some consumer in unbuffered mode.

Dchan exposes only one file for settings and metrics. It is called
**ctl** and remove or change of metadata (wstat) is forbidden on it.
The system supports dynamic change of settings by writing to this file.
Read the file to get the current settings and metrics.
More information about settings and metrics in the [[Ctl][Ctl]] section.

Dchan-proxy is a local unix socket 9P server created to simplify
client applications, avoiding other semantics related to network
connection in apps trying to communicate.  The linux kernel will
establish a 9P connection to dchan-proxy for each application, and
dchan-proxy will establish a 9P connection over TCP with
dchan. Dchan-proxy will proxy 9P requests to dchan server, but it is
designed for block the client in the file's syscalls in case of
network failure with dchan. It stores the state of call and re-apply
when re-connected. This way, client applications will never know that
something bad occurred in the network (except that some syscalls like
read blocked for some time).

* Ctl

Dchan has only one special served file called ctl to manage channel
metrics and settings.

*** Metrics

The only metrics exposed until now is:

- rx - Receiver rate in messages/second.
- tx - Transmission rate in messages/second.
- arx - Average rx.
- atx - Average tx.

You can get this statistics reading the ctl file, like below:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ cd /n/dchan
$ cat ctl
/core/input    0    25221    25221    25221    25221
/data/input    256  35002    34255    36222    36025

#+END_SRC

The output format is:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
<filename>    <channel size>    <rx>    <tx>    <arx>    <atx>
#+END_EXAMPLE

The blank separator is TAB.

The metrics are updated each second.

*** Settings

For now, there's only one setting available: channel size.

See below the format to update the channel size for file /data/input:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ cd /n/dchan
$ mkdir data
$ touch data/input
$ cat ctl
/data/input    0    0    0    0    0
$ echo "/data/input 256" >> ctl

#+END_SRC

The size of channel can be updated at any time, but be aware that during
the update of channel the file operations on this specific file will
block until finished.

* Building

To build the software you can execute:

#+NAME: building
#+CAPTION: building
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
make
#+END_SRC


* Development

As stated before, Dchan is a literate program, then this document is
all you need to understand all of it's concepts, design choices,
and get the source code.

It was developed using [[http://orgmode.org/][orgmode]], but isn't required to use emacs to
build or contribute to the project. The project is composed of org
files and a full featured Makefile. The Makefile have all of the
commands you need to generate the book on various formats, extract the
source code, build the software, execute tests, and so on.

If you use Emacs editor, you don't need this Makefile at all, because
orgmode is full integrated.

For non-emacs developers, the development process is:

1. Change org files;
2. Run make

*Never touch the generated source code.*

* Dependencies

- Org dependency

If you use Emacs, everything is already installed.

For non-emacs developers, install [[https://github.com/fniessen/orgmk][orgmk]].

- Go

Read the [[https://golang.org/doc/install][Go Getting started]] tutorial.

* Implementation

** dchan-proxy

** Makefile

First of all, we need a Makefile to build this document and source
code.

The most used commands are:

- **make** to make a full rebuild of everything.
- **make tangle** to extract source code
- **make build** to build dchan software
